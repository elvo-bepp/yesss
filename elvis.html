                              Hey Moseti,you‚Äôre not just my girlfriend, you‚Äôre also my best friend, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt ask for a better person to have by my side. From study sessions to our random laughs, every moment with you is special. With Valentine‚Äôs Day coming up, I just want to make it even more memorable with you. So, bestie and my gf..hehe, will you be my valentine? ....AS always....infinity and beyond, with you always. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
                        </p>
